# CodingChallenge
for M&B by Patric Shim

Clone the repo or download the zip file containing the a project.
Download and Run Android Studio and open the project file in CodingChallenge by pointing to the build.gradle file inside the main project folder.
Sync the gradle file and hit run using any device or emulator you choose up to API 21. All the dependencies should already be in the 
gradle file and should be fetching them for you.
There is a small Espresso test in the package that should be labelled SearchTest. You can either right click SearchTest 
and click Run test or go to the top and change the configuration to run the test instead of building the app.
